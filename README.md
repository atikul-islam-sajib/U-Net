## Project Structure Overview

This project is thoughtfully organized into several key directories, each serving a distinct role in the development and deployment process. Here's a detailed outline of the project structure along with descriptions for each directory:

- **`checkpoints/`**: Stores model checkpoints during training.
  - `best_model/`: Contains the best performing model checkpoints.
  - `train_models/`: Contains all model checkpoints generated during training.
- **`data/`**: Organized into processed and raw data, facilitating efficient data management.
  - `processed/`: Processed data ready for modeling.
  - `raw/`: Original, unmodified data.
- **`logs/`**: Log files for debugging and tracking model training progress.
- **`metrics/`**: Stores files related to model performance metrics.
- **`outputs/`**: Output artifacts from model runs.
  - `test_images/`: Images generated during testing.
  - `train_gif/`: GIFs compiled from training images.
  - `train_images/`: Images generated during training.
- **`research/`**: Space for exploratory data analysis and experimental notebooks.
  - `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for research, experiments, and analyses.
