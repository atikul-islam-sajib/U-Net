| `torchaudio`     | An extension for PyTorch that provides audio processing tools, making it easier to load, process, and augment audio data for deep learning models.                    |
| `torchvision`    | Offers datasets, model architectures, and common image transformations for computer vision. It complements PyTorch and simplifies dataset manipulation and preprocessing. |
| `python`         | The core language used. Ensure you have the correct Python version installed as required by the project.                                                              |
| `scikit-learn`   | A versatile machine learning library for Python, providing simple and efficient tools for data analysis and modeling. It's widely used for classical ML algorithms.   |
| `matplotlib`     | A plotting library for Python which is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.                                                  |
| `seaborn`        | Based on matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.                                             |
| `pandas`         | An open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. It's essential for handling structured data.                      |
| `mkdocs`         | A fast and simple static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown.                      |
| `yaml`           | Not a library but a format. However, libraries like PyYAML are used to parse YAML files in Python. Useful for configuration files and data serialization.             |
| `opencv-python`  | A library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. It allows for the manipulation and processing of images and videos for further analysis.     |
